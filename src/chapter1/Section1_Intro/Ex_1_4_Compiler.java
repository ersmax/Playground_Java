    What is a compiler?
     */
    // Answer: A compiler is a special program that translates source code
    // written in a high-level programming language (like Java)
    // into machine code or bytecode that a computer's processor can execute.
    // This translation process allows the program to be run on a specific platform
    // or environment.
    // For Java, the compiler translates source code into machine code for a virtual
    // machine (JVM) or simply put byte-code,
    // which is then interpreted or compiled into machine code at runtime by the JVM
    // producing object program or object code.

    // Formally:
    // A compiler translates a program written in a programming language such as Java
    // into a program in a low-level language. When you compile a Java program, the
    // compiler translates your Java program into a program expressed in Java byte-code.
