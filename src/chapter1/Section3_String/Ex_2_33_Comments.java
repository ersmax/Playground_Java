 */

// Answer:
// There are two kinds of comments in Java:
// 1. Inline comments: These comments start with //
//    and extend to the end of the line. They are used by code writer or programmers who modify the code,
//    not by programmer who merely uses the code.
// 2. Block comments: These comments start with /* and end with * / (without the space).
//    They are used as a documentation for users of our code.
//    Also used for javadoc.
